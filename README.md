# Linux System Programming in C

This repository contains a series of C programs designed to demonstrate various aspects of Linux-based system programming. The projects cover key operating system concepts and low-level programming techniques, including process management, synchronization, inter-process communication, memory management, and network programming.

Each program showcases practical implementations of system calls, concurrency management, file operations, and IPC, providing insight into the inner workings of Linux operating systems.

## Key Features:
- **System-Level Programming**: Real-world examples of working with processes, threads, file systems, signals, and memory management.
- **Concurrency**: Implementation of synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, semaphores, barriers, and thread pools.
- **IPC Mechanisms**: Examples of FIFO pipes, POSIX message queues, shared memory, and sockets for inter-process communication.
- **Network Programming**: Implementation of socket-based communication and event-driven programming using `epoll`.
